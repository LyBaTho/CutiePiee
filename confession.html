            </p>
            <p>Good morning, my beloved Princess <3</p>
            <p>I’m writing this message as the sky is dark and the air is cold, yet just looking at your pictures forever warms my heart.</p>
            <p>The year is coming to an end, and I still can’t believe how quickly time flies. It’s been tough living far from home, especially with an earth-sized distance between me and you - my other half. Yet, I’m deeply grateful for all your kind words and unwavering support, even though we’re a thousand miles away. I’m truly thankful that you continue to be so courageous, staying strong and agreeing to walk this journey along with me. I still remember our conversations, your honest words about disliking uncertainty, how you wanted to be sure of the future. Yet here you are, still in this relationship with me, despite all the unknowns. No words can truly express how much that means to me, my Dear.</p>
            <p>I know how difficult a long-distance relationship can be, especially at this time of year—Christmas, when other couples share intimate moments, warm cuddles, gentle kisses, and loving words. Meanwhile, we can only see each other through the cold glow of a screen. Sometimes, I feel jealous of couples walking hand in hand, sharing their lives each day, while I lay in bed, surrounded by silence, wishing you were here.</p>
            <p>I realize that writing these words might remind you of the challenges ahead. But, my Love, be brave. As long as we have each other, everything will be okay. Recently, I came across a writer’s wise words about love at a distance: "Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire." He spoke of how true love endures absence—that when two hearts are meant to be, distance only makes them stronger. I believe in us, in our grand, unshakable love that can weather any stormy night.</p>
            <p> My dearest Princess, I want you to know that I will love you with all my heart, every single day. I promise to work hard—not only for myself but for us. Day by day, I will put in the effort to make this love stronger, to cherish you, and to nurture our bond. I know the road isn’t always easy, but I’ll walk it step by step, knowing that you are my destination.</p>
            <p>Before I close, my Sunshine, I want you to know that the day you entered my life, everything changed for the better. I cannot imagine my world without you in it. Christmas is a time for gifts, for reflecting on the year past, and for welcoming the hopes of the year to come. I’m grateful for every moment we’ve shared, and I dream of all the moments still ahead with you.</p>
            <p>I cannot wait for the day we’re together again—to touch your soft skin, kiss you deeply, and feel you close. Until then, I’ll hold you dear in my heart.</p>
            <p><strong>Yours faithfully,</strong><br>Ba Tho</p>
